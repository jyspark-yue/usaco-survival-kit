# usaco-survival-kit
Welcome to **USACO Survival Kit** — my daily journey to tackle USACO problems, grow as a competitive programmer, and have some fun along the way 🧠✨

This isn't just a problem dump — it's:
- A **learning log** of patterns, struggles, and breakthroughs
- A **guidebook** for beginners who want clarity and encouragement
- A place where **mistakes are part of the process** (and logged too!)

## 🎯 Goals
- ✅ Solve 1 USACO problem every day
- ✍️ Explain each solution in plain English
- 📊 Track my growth, patterns, and favorite strategies
- 🧠 Learn from every mistake (and record it!)
